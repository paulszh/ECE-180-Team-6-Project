# ECE 180 Team 6 Project Proposal: San Diego Real Estate Price Analysis

## Purpose: 
The purpose of our project is to use the historical home/rent prices near the La Jolla area to determine which neighborhoods are the most in demand and how fair a listing price is. As a result, UCSD students and faculty will have a useful guide to help them to make better decisions when it comes to finding off-campus housing. In addition, we hope our analysis will also give the current homeowners a more robust understanding of how much their property is worth and what are the main factors which contribute to that.
We believe this is a fairly important topic because almost everyone will eventually have to look for a new place to live, but real estate prices can be quite volatile and difficult to predict.
Due to limited on-campus apartment spaces and high rent, each year, thousands of UCSD students and faculty in particular need to seek off-campus housing near campus. However, the number of available housing spaces and the monthly rent prices can vary significantly from month to month. We are planning to collect and analyze the historical house rental prices and the available apartments in La Jolla area. We may take into account a few important factors like distance to school, tenantâ€˜s review and available parking spaces into our analysis. Optionally, we may also use the collected data to predict the future rental prices and make some recommendations.

## Data Acquisition/Analysis: 
Zillow is a very well-known real estate database company, and so the historical data on their website will be the primary source of data for our project. We will need to install the OpenPyXL module in Python in order to read the Excel spreadsheets. In addition, for any data scraping from other sources, we may also use the Lxml and BeautifulSoup modules as well. We will eventually use NumPy to help organize and format the data, and Matplotlib to create the visual plots.
