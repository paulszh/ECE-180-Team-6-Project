# ECE 180 Team 6 Project Proposal: San Diego Real Estate Price Analysis

## Purpose: 
The purpose of our project is to use the historical home/rent prices near the La Jolla area to determine which neighborhoods are the most in demand and how fair a listing price is. Our goal is to help UCSD students and faculty to make better decisions when it comes to finding off-campus housing. In addition, we hope our analysis will also give the current homeowners a more robust understanding of how much their property is worth and which area have better investment value in the future. We may also use the collected dataset and apply some simple machine learning algorithm to predict the housing price in 2018.
